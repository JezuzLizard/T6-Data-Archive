Problem: Caused by trying to call a function from a script but no script is including the script which contains that function.

Note: Doesn't happen with https://github.com/xensik/gsc-tool

Exact line 520: byte_2DF3ED8[v464 + dword_2DF3EF8[a1]] = *(_BYTE *)v12;

Example:

main()
{
	scripts/zm/grief/gametype_modules/_power::init_replacements();
}

Solution: Add #include scripts/zm/grief/gametype_modules/_power; to the top of the file.
